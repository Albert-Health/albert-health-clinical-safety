# Clinical Safety of the Albert Health Voice-based Digital Health Platform Project

## Clinical Safety

### Digital Technology Assessment Criteria (DTAC)

- DTAC is a UK(England)-only grouping of assessment criteria. It is relatively new, and aims to simply bring together and harmonise _existing_ assessment criteria for digital technologies. More information is available on [the NHSX website](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/digital-technology-assessment-criteria-dtac/)

- DTAC incorporates the DCB0129 and DCB0160 standards for clinical safety, which the Albert Health Voice-based Digital Health Platform is compliant with.

### DCB0129 and DCB0160 Compliance
