# Clinical Safety of the Albert Health Voice-based Digital Health Platform Project

## Intended Use and Important Limitations

The Albert Health Voice-based Digital Health Platform is intended as an adjunct to existing clinical care provision, supporting patients in managing enteral nutrition at home. It is not intended as a replacement for standard channels of communication between Health Care Professionals (HCPs) and patients.

The UK-localised version is the only version considered by this Clinical Safety Documentation.

The Telehealth features of the Albert Health application are not being used in the UK version and have not been reviewed.

## Digital Technology Assessment Criteria (DTAC)

- DTAC is a UK(England)-only grouping of assessment criteria. It is relatively new, and aims to simply bring together and harmonise _existing_ assessment criteria for digital technologies. More information is available on [the NHSX website](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/digital-technology-assessment-criteria-dtac/)

- DTAC incorporates the DCB0129 and DCB0160 standards for clinical safety, which the Albert Health Voice-based Digital Health Platform is compliant with.

## DCB0129 and DCB0160 Compliance

This Clinical Safety Management File includes all documentation relevant to the Manufacture of clinical software (DCB0129). It is intended that Clinical Safety Officers in implementation sites will be able to easily obtain this Clinical Safety Management File and use it to develop their DCB0160 (Implementation) Clinical Safety Case.

## DCB0129 Hazard Log

Our Hazard Log is managed on GitHub in the open. Details of how this works are [here](/hazard-log.md).

## Downloading this documentation as a PDF

We have prepared this documentation using the tools of the modern Web (MarkDown, static HTML site generation) in order to present a linkable, searchable, interactive documentation site which is version controlled using Git and is openly available.

We are aware that some organisations may wish to download a 'simulated paper' document such as a PDF, and for this reason we have set up the site to automatically generate a PDF version of the entire documentation, which can be downloaded [here](./download.md)
