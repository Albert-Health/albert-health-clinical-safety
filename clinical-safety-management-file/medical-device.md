Determination of the class of medical device applicable was performed using the [MHRA Medical Device Class tool](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/957090/Software_flow_chart_Ed_1-07b-UKCA__002__FINAL.pdf) on 20th October 2022 by Dr Marcus Baw, with reference to relevant supporting documents and legislation.

It was determined that the Albert Health platform **does not** constitute a medical device.
