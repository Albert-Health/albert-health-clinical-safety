# Clinical Safety of the Albert Health Voice-based Digital Health Platform Project

## Clinical Safety

### Open Source, Transparency and Open Governance

In addition to the standard NHS clinical safety practices, a key aspect of the augmented clinical safety measures we have taken with the dGC platform is the open source codebase and completely open governance profile of the project.

Our entire codebase is open for inspection by other specialists, in a manner similar to the open peer review of academic publications which ensures high quality by enabling others to replicate our results and verify or challenge the veracity of the calculations independently. (Note that we do not in any way **rely** on such external validation or challenge - we have ourselves extensively internally tested the API and underlying calculations)

### Digital Technology Assessment Criteria (DTAC)

- DTAC is a UK(England)-only grouping of assessment criteria. It is relatively new, and aims to simply bring together and harmonise _existing_ assessment criteria for digital technologies. More information is available on [the NHSX website](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/digital-technology-assessment-criteria-dtac/)

- DTAC incorporates the DCB0129 and DCB0160 standards for clinical safety, which the Albert Health Voice-based Digital Health Platform is compliant with.

### DCB0129 and DCB0160 Compliance

### Hazard Logs

Our Hazard Logs are managed on GitHub in the open. Details of how this works are [here](/hazard-log.md).
